# workit
## overview: 
This simple program uses python's docx library to replace a template and to create an intuitive and decisive coverl etter building tool.  There are document variables things such as the header or the closing There are user defined variables from inputs There are randomized variables that are selected from list and predefined dictionary based text There is also static text that help shape the cover letter.

The program will ask for some input but it requires you to modify the dictionaries, the lists and static text. That will help you generate coverletter and resume quickly and rapidly. The documents will be saved in the doc folder. 

There are three paragraphs but you can change it around meet your own template. I have not removed all of my own variables but with limited understanding of python you can change code to make something that actually makes sense. 

### Additionally...
The application concludes with a dataframe that is designed to save the files you made. You can easily integrate this with MongoDB and google sheets so you can keep track of where and when you sent out a resume.
